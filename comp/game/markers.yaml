summary: Organise markers for the arena

priority: major

component: Competition

milestone: $SRYYYY Competition

description: >-
  The arena (and, possibly, things inside it) is marked with libkoki
  markers, which need printing off in advance.

  For the arena itself SR has some pre-printed libkoki markers on a
  plastic backing which are re-used each year. These need checking
  and ensuring they make it to the venue. Replacements may be needed
  for any markers which are showing wear.
